My name is Pruthak Joshi. I have completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I like machines to look and behave as per my liking, which led me to pursue my studies in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Computer Aided Design and Automation. If you want to check out a few of my projects, visit my [projects](https://pruthakjoshi.github.io/projects/) page. 

I enjoy playing tennis, and regularly follow Formula-1, and am a tifosi by heart.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
