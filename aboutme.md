I am a mechanical engineer who believes robots will define the future.  

Currently, I’m building practical and innovative robotic solutions at <a href="https://www.skild.ai/"><strong>Skild AI</strong></a>. Previously, I worked at <strong>Reazon Holdings</strong> in Tokyo, where I contributed to the <a href="https://openarm.dev/">OpenArm</a> project. I hold a Master’s in Systems and Control from <strong>UCLA</strong> and a Bachelor’s (and Master’s) in Mechanical Engineering from <strong>IIT Bombay</strong>.  

Curious about what I’ve been tinkering with? Check out my <a href="https://pruthakjoshi.github.io/projects/">projects page</a>.

### A Bit About Me
When I’m not designing robots, you might find me:  
- Hitting tennis balls on the court  
- Following Formula-1 (yes, I’m a Tifosi!)  
- Playing cricket or watching the game  
- Exploring new places and hunting for the best ice cream 🍦  
- Watching movies — “The Shawshank Redemption” is my all-time favorite

### Journey & Highlights

#### Mars Rover Adventures
I joined the <a href="https://iitbmartian.github.io/">IITB Mars Rover Team</a> as a Junior Design Engineer and eventually led the team as Team Leader. We built semi-autonomous rovers for competitions like the <a href="https://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a> and <a href="https://roverchallenge.org/">International Rover Challenge</a>. Under my leadership, the team achieved 4th place in the Indian Rover Design Challenge 2020 — the best-ever finish for IITB.

#### Mentoring & Leadership
Mentoring has been one of my most rewarding experiences. Through IITB’s <a href="https://smp.gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/index.html">Student Mentor Programme</a>, I guided juniors academically and personally as an Institute Student Mentor and Department Academic Mentor for 2 years. Helping others navigate their IITB journey taught me a lot about leadership, teamwork, and patience — sometimes in equal measure.
