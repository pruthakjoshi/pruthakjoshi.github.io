My name is Pruthak Joshi. I have completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I like machines to look and behave as per my liking, which led me to pursue my studies in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Computer Aided Design and Automation. If you want to check out a few of my projects, visit my [projects](https://pruthakjoshi.github.io/projects/) page. 

I enjoy playing tennis, and regularly follow Formula-1, and am a Tifosi by heart (Go Charles!!!). As with almost all Indians, I am also an avid follower of cricket, and enjoy playing a game or two occasionally. I like exploring new places, and am always up to go ice-cream hunting. I also enjoy watching movies, "The Shawshank Redemption" being my all time favourite.
